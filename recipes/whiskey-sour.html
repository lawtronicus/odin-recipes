    <h2>What is a Whiskey Sour?</h2>
        <p>The Whiskey Sour can be seen as a cousin to the <a href="old-fashioned.html">old fashioned</a> and dates back to a similar time period. 
        While the Old Fashioned relies on bitters, the Whiskey Sour combines citrus, usually lemon juice, with sugar, and rye or bourbon as the main spirit.</p>
        <p>Two popular cousins of this drink are the Boston Sour, which includes egg white to create foam, and the New York Sour, which includes a float of red wine. 
            Although the inclusion of egg white technically makes the drink a boston sour, it has become so ubiquitous that it is often taken as part of the original Whiskey Sour recipe, 
            and we will include it here.</p>
