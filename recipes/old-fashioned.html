        <h2>What is an Old Fashioned?</h2>
            <p>The Old Fashioned is sometimes referred to as "the original cocktail." Though we can quibble about whether or not it was actually the first (it wasn't), there is no doubt that it has helped to define what it means to be a cocktail.
            The Old Fashioned is made simply by combining sugar, bitters, and whiskey (typically the American/Canadian variety, i.e., rye or bourbon), and normally involves some dilution by stirring with ice. This contrasts it with the Whiskey Sour (and other sours), which is a combination of whiskey, sugar, and citrus, normally shaken with ice.</p>
